# Calculator GUI - App.java

This project provides a simple calculator application built using Java Swing. The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with an intuitive layout and interactive buttons.

## Features
- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Remainder** operations
- Two input fields for numbers
- Operator selection via dedicated buttons
- Number buttons for each input field
- Clear button to reset inputs and operator
- Responsive and visually styled buttons

## How It Works
- Enter numbers in the two input fields using the number buttons below each field.
- Select an operator (+, -, *, /, %) by clicking the corresponding button.
- Click the `=` button to perform the calculation (implementation for calculation logic can be added).
- Use the `Clear` button to reset all fields.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```powershell
   javac App.java
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```powershell
   java App
   ```

## Customization
- You can modify the layout, fonts, and colors by editing the relevant sections in `App.java`.
- To add more functionality (e.g., calculation logic), implement the action for the `=` button.

## File Structure
- `App.java` - Main source file containing the calculator GUI code
